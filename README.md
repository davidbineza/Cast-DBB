# CAST DBB — Podcaster / Influencer Starter Website (Updated)

This project is a simple single-page starter website built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap CDN.
Updated to include the Contact form.

## Files
- `index.html` — main page with About, Episodes, Media, Contact sections
- `styles.css` — custom styles (animation for "CAST")
- `script.js` — interactivity (subscribe & contact demo)
- `README.md` — this file

## How to use
1. Unzip the package.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Replace placeholder images, audio sources and links with your real content.

## Notes
- The contact and subscribe forms are demo-only and do not send emails. Hook them up to your backend or form service (Formspree, Netlify forms, etc.) to receive messages.
- Mic icon/logo uses a public CDN link in the starter. Replace with your own SVG/PNG as needed.
